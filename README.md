# Java Data Structures and Algorithms:



### 7 MAY 2021
### Features:
### Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

### 1. AddNode()
- Adds a new node to the graph
- Takes in the value of that node
- Returns the added node
### 2. AddEdge()
- Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
- Include the ability to have a “weight”
- Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
    - Both nodes should already be in the Graph
### 3. GetNodes()
- Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
### 4. GetNeighbors()
- Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
- Takes in a given node
- Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
### 5. Size()
- Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

### Features:
### Extend your graph object with a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection.

### Features
### Write a function based on the specifications above, which takes in a graph, and an array of city names. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.
